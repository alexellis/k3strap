# k3sup ðŸš€ (said 'ketchup')

k3sup is a light-weight utility to get from zero to KUBECONFIG with [k3s](https://k3s.io/) on any local or remote VM. All you need is `ssh` access and the `k3sup` binary to get `kubectl` access immediately.

The tool is written in Go and is cross-compiled for Linux, Windows, MacOS and even on Raspberry Pi.

How do you say it? Ketchup, as in tomato.

## What's this for? ðŸ’»

This tool installs `k3s`, updates the SAN address to the public IP, downloads the k3s config file and then updates it with the public IP address of your VM so that you can connect to it with `kubectl`. It automates everything and is very fast.

You may wonder why a tool like this needs to exist when you can do this sort of thing with bash.

k3sup was developed to automate what can be a very manual and confusing process for many developers, who are already short on time. Once you've provisioned a VM with your favourite tooling, `k3sup` means you are only 60 seconds away from `kubectl get pods`, from your own computer.

Uses:

* Bootstrap Kubernetes with k3s onto any VM - either manually, during CI or through `cloudinit`
* Get from zero to `kubectl` with `k3s` on Raspberry Pi (RPi), VMs, DigitalOcean, Civo, Scaleway and more
* Fetch a KUBECONFIG from an existing `k3s` cluster

## Demo ðŸ“¼

I install k3s onto two separate machines and get access to `kubeconfig` within a minute.

* Ubuntu 18.04 VM created on DigitalOcean with ssh key copied automatically
* Raspberry Pi 4 with my ssh key copied over via `ssh-copy-id`

## Usage âœ…

```sh
curl -sLS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexellis/k3sup/master/get.sh | sh
sudo install k3sup /usr/local/bin/
```

Provision a new VM running a compatible operating system such as Ubuntu, Debian, Raspbian, or something else. Make sure that you opt-in to copy your registered SSH keys over to the new VM or host automatically.

> Note: You can copy ssh keys to a remote VM with `ssh-copy-id user@IP`.

Imagine the IP was `192.168.0.1` and the username was `ubuntu`, then you would run this:

* Run `k3sup`:

```sh
export IP=192.168.0.1
k3sup install --ip $IP --user ubuntu
```

Other options for `install`:

* `--skip-install` - if you already have k3s installed, you can just run this command to get the `kubeconfig`
* `--ssh-key` - specify a specific path for the SSH key for remote login
* `--local-path` - default is `./kubeconfig` - set the path into which you want to save your VM's `kubeconfig`
* `--ssh-port` - default is `22`, but you can specify an alternative port i.e. `2222`

* Now try the access:

```sh
export KUBECONFIG=`pwd`/kubeconfig
kubectl get node
```

### Micro-tutorial for Raspberry Pi (2, 3, or 4) ðŸ¥§

In a few moments you will have Kubernetes up and running on your Raspberry Pi 2, 3 or 4. Stand by for the fastest possible install. At the end you will have a KUBECONFIG file on your local computer that you can use to access your cluster remotely.

* [Download etcher.io](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) for your OS

* Flash an SD card using [Raspbian Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)

* Generate an ssh-key if you don't already have one with `ssh-keygen` (hit enter to all questions)

* Find the RPi IP with `ping -c raspberrypi.local`, then set `export IP=""` with the IP

* Copy over your ssh key with: `ssh-copy-id pi@raspberrypi.local`

* Run `k3sup --ip $IP --user pi`

* Point at the config file and get the status of the node:

```sh
export KUBECONFIG=`pwd`/kubeconfig
kubectl get node -o wide
```

You now have `kubectl` access from your laptop to your Raspberry Pi running k3s.

## Caveats on security

If you are using public cloud, then make sure you see the notes from the Rancher team on setting up a Firewall or Security Group.
